{"name":"Lisst","tagline":"A small web app for making and editing lists, written in Sinatra","body":"### Why?\r\nI created Lisst because I needed an online trip log that was easy to update while I'm on the go. It's designed with simplicity and minimalism in mind, and can be run easily on Heroku.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n- Responsive retina-ready stylesheet\r\n- Google authentication\r\n- Postgres or SQLite3 databases supported out of the box\r\n- Easily extendable (built with Sinatra, ActiveRecord, and OmniAuth)\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\nTools needed: Ruby 2.0, bundler, sqlite3, heroku toolbelt (optional)\r\n```\r\n$ \r\n$ \r\n$ \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nLisst is a one-man project by @qrohlf. If you've done something cool with Lisst, I'd love to see it, so shoot me an email at [qr@qrohlf.com](mailto:qr@qrohlf.com). I'm happy to accept pull requests, but keep in mind that this is intended to be a very minimalist project, with a focus on creating a simple and easy-to use app rather than a feature-rich one.\r\n\r\n### Support\r\nIf you're having trouble getting Lisst to work, shoot a tweet to [@qrohlf](https://twitter.com/qrohlf) or email me at [qr@qrohlf.com](mailto:qr@qrohlf.com).
