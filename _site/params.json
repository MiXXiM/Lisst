If you've done something cool with Lisst, I'd love to see it, so shoot me an email at [qr@qrohlf.com](mailto:qr@qrohlf.com). I'm happy to accept pull requests, but keep in mind that this is intended to be a very minimalist project, with a focus on creating a simple and easy-to use app rather than a feature-rich one.\r\n\r\n### Support\r\nIf you're having trouble getting Lisst to work, shoot a tweet to [@qrohlf](https://twitter.com/qrohlf) or email me at [qr@qrohlf.com](mailto:qr@qrohlf.com).
